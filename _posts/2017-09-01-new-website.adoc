{feelpp} has yet again a new website.
We had for a long time a jekyll (markdown) based website with news shared between link:http://www.cemosis.fr[Cemosis] and the link:http://csmi.eu[Master CSMI].
We moved the latters to WordPress CMS 2 years ago and {feelpp} a few month ago.

At the same time we moved our documentation system to Asciidoc using Asciidoctor tools to generated webpages on the link:http://book.feelpp.org[{feelpp} book].
Asciidoc enables very powerful formatting including code and math.
It is much more feature rich than markdown and asciidoctor has awesome developpment and support.
