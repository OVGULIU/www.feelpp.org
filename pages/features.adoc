== Domain Specific Embedded Language in {cpp} for the Finite Element Method

{feelpp} embeds in {cpp} mathematical concepts through an expressive DSEL

* Mesh
** Supports 1D to 3D as well as curves and surfaces including high order.
** Supports mesh partitioning and fast i/o for large scale meshes
** Supports mesh extraction and efficient operations between related meshes
* Function Spaces
** Supports function spaces with a large range of finite elements.
** Supports seamless interpolation between meshes
** Supports cartesian product of spaces, views on subspaces and subelements
* Variational formulation
** Supports bilinear and linear forms concepts.
** Supports forms on cartesian product spaces
** Supports block forms on different spaces
* Post Processing
** Supports high order meshes and approximations.
** Supports various formats: ensight, vtk, xdmf, gmsh
** Supports post-processing quantities such as average values

== Galerkin Methods

{feelpp} supports

* Continuous Galerkin methods
* Discussions Galerkin methods
* Hybrid Discussions Galerkin methods
* Reduced Basis methods
* Leveset methods
* Fictitous domain methods

== Scalable

{feelpp} uses MPI for parallel computing.
Regarding algebraic solutions {feelpp} uses PETSc as the main backend for large scale computations.


== Toolboxes

{feelpp} supports variouts toolboxes:

* Computational fluid dynamics
* Computational solid mechanics
* Heat transfer
* Fluid structure interaction
* Aerothermics
* Thermoelectric
* Thermo-mechanics
* Maxwell

== Wide range of applications
